# Battleship
### Note: This is very much work in progress
Building battleship in Typescript and then in Svelte. Run the server using run_server.sh, should work out of the box. \
To rebuild the typescript files you need to replace the path in battleship_ts/build.sh with the path to your esbuild executable. \
